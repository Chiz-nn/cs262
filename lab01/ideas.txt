Exercise 1.1

- I thought that it would be a great idea to build some sort of social app exclusively for calvin students. Due to the lack of social events and very limited interaction in dorms
new students (and maybe even some returning students) arent making the connections that they would typically make in a corona free semester.  The app could allow people upload pictures
, give some background information and swipe on other sudents theyd like to connect with. So basically you could swipe right if you see someone whose interests align with yours
or swipe left if they dont and if both of you swipe right then its a match and then you can commence interaction with the person (virtually that is)


- WACKY IDEA
An application that allows you to talk directly to your computer and have it display code in any programming language of your choice. It would be super convenient if 
you could just talk throught the ideas i your head and your computer would do a kind of voice to text conversion but instead it would be code. It doesnt have to be perfect
afterwards you could edit what has already been displayed on the screen
