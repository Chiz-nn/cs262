# CS 262- lab11

 I reviewed the following suggestions in news.js in my team's project client using ESLint.



- There were a few spelling errors that were corrected so i implemented most of their suggestions
- Deleted all variables and declarations that were not used
- Accepted all indentation suggestions and whitespace changes
- Switched any let assignments to const if they are not reassigned



REJECTED SUGGESTIONS
- The formatter suggested that i nest a function inside another function for some reason but i ignored it because it wasnt going to return
the desired outcome
- ESLint by default wants unneccessary semicolons removed, google javascript style says they should be kept
